@MotivationMatrix342,"I am very thankful to you sir for uploading this video and making it so easy for us to learn spring boot. 
But the code you wrote for 'deleteEmployee' method at 1:36:03 did not work perfectly in my computer. The following code worked for me:

@Override
    public boolean deleteEmployee(Long id) {
        // Find the employee with the given ID
        Employee employeeToRemove = null;
        for (Employee emp : employees) {
            if (emp.getId().equals(id)) {
                employeeToRemove = emp;
                break;
            }
        }

        // If employee found, remove it from the list
        if (employeeToRemove != null) {
            employees.remove(employeeToRemove);
            return true;
        } else {
            return false; // Employee not found
        }
    }"

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write, and easy for machines to parse and generate. It is a text-based format that is often used to transmit data between a server and a web application, as an alternative to XML (eXtensible Markup Language).

JSON is based on a key-value pair structure, where data is represented as a collection of name/value pairs. The data types supported in JSON include:

1. Objects: Enclosed in curly braces {}, an object is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. The keys are strings, and the values can be strings, numbers, objects, arrays, booleans, or null.

   Example:
   json
   {
     ""name"": ""John Doe"",
     ""age"": 30,
     ""city"": ""New York""
   }
   

2. Arrays: An ordered list of values, enclosed in square brackets []. Array elements can be of any data type, including objects or other arrays.

   Example:
   json
   [
     ""apple"",
     ""orange"",
     ""banana""
   ]
   

3. Strings: Enclosed in double quotes """", strings represent a sequence of characters.

   Example:
   json
   ""Hello, World!""
   

4. Numbers: JSON supports numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

   Example:
   json
   42
   

5. Booleans: Represented as true or false.

   Example:
   json
   true
   

6. Null: Represents an empty or undefined value.

   Example:
   json
   null
   

JSON is widely used for configuration files, APIs (Application Programming Interfaces), and data exchange between different programming languages and platforms due to its simplicity, readability, and ease of parsing."
