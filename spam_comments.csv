@MotivationMatrix342,"I am very thankful to you sir for uploading this video and making it so easy for us to learn spring boot. 
But the code you wrote for 'deleteEmployee' method at 1:36:03 did not work perfectly in my computer. The following code worked for me:

@Override
    public boolean deleteEmployee(Long id) {
        // Find the employee with the given ID
        Employee employeeToRemove = null;
        for (Employee emp : employees) {
            if (emp.getId().equals(id)) {
                employeeToRemove = emp;
                break;
            }
        }

        // If employee found, remove it from the list
        if (employeeToRemove != null) {
            employees.remove(employeeToRemove);
            return true;
        } else {
            return false; // Employee not found
        }
    }"
